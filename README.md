## How it works
### Pre-requisites
Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
- Gradle
- JDK 1.8+

or 
- Docker

### Running server with Gradle
```bash
# Builds the application
$ ./gradlew clean build
or
$ gradle clean build

# Run the application 
$ java -jar ./build/libs/transferapi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar;
# The server will start at port: 8080 - go to http://localhost:8080
```

### Running server with Docker
```bash
# Build and run the application 
$ make
or 
$ make docker_build_run
# The server will start at port: 8080 - go to http://localhost:8080

# Stop docker container
$ make docker_stop
```

### Running tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
$ ./gradlew test

# Run integration tests
$ ./gradlew iT
```

### Basic API Information
Application starts on localhost port 8080 [http://localhost:8080/api] 

| Method | Path                                        | Usage                          |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| POST   | /api/clientAccount/register                 | register a new account         |
| GET    | /api/clientAccount/accounts                 | retrieve all accounts          |
| GET    | /api/clientAccount/accounts/{accountNumber} | retrieve a specific account    |
| POST   | /api/transfers                              | register a new transfer        |
| GET    | /api/transfers/{accountNumber}              | retrieve all account transfers |

409 Conflict: The request has some conflict
404 Not Found: The resource wasn't found
500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition
```

## Tech Stack
The following tools were used in the construction of the project:
- **Java 11**
- **Gradle**
- **RESTful API**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Lombok**
- **H2 in memory Database**
- **Junit4 and Mockito**
- **RestAssured**

## Improves

- Implement redis as a queue for "lock" the accounts that are concurrent to avoid conflicts. For example, if a coming
transfer operation has an account that is already on redis (with a TTL as database) then it should wait a bit and retried
the operation.
- Use some ordered queue feature for resilience, like AWS SQS, in case of some problem with server the data won't be lost.
- Delete and Update operations
